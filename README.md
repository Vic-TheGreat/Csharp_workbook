- [ ] arithmetic operations ( +, - * , /, etc) on `Char` or when accessing char xters in a `string` will return the ASCII value (i.e numbers) of each char respectively.
```txt
Ex: string word1= "mum"; string word2 = "dad";
    for (int i = 0; i < word1.Length; i++)
      {
       var aa = word1[i];            //output: mom
       var bb = word1[i] + word2[i]; // output: 209208209
      }
      
- [ ] You cannot access/do anything with a null object. Hence, take precaution, initialize! Ex, string.Empty for strings & int = 0.
- [ ] StringBuilder 'append' to add to strings instead of writing to the console. This is more efficient.
